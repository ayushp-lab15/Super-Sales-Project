# Super-Sales-Project
Superstore Sales Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing sales data from one of Canada's largest retail stores, Superstore Sales. Our main objective is to gain insights into which product subcategories are generating profits and which ones are causing losses. Based on these insights, strategic business decisions can be made, such as discontinuing loss-making subcategories or implementing other strategies to improve profitability.
**The analysis is divided into two main activities:
**
**Activity 1: Data Preparation and Basic Report Making
Activity 2: Analysis of High-Profit and Loss-Making Categories
**
